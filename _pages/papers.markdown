## Paper Track Call for Submissions
### Re-Thinking, Re-Defining, Re-Imagining Data

This year, we invite a dialogue on the topic and terminology around “data”, a contested term within and between a range of disciplines - very broadly speaking, the meaning and implications of the term “data” can vastly differ across the sciences and humanities and related subfields. There are varying perspectives on the meaning and use of data that impact how we engage and debate it. “Data” seems core to visualization! Or is it?

We are especially interested in a number of open questions in this space, including but not limited to the following:
* What counts as data in humanities visualizations? How are marginalized forms of data mobilized?

* What makes data data (or not data)? Is data always digital?

* What methods can be explored for constructing, collecting, and/or analyzing data at the intersection of visualization and the (digital) humanities? How does data and its representations affect our interpretations?

* What gets lost and/or constructed when transforming data? How can we make constructions/transformations visible?

* How do we visually measure and convey differences in data?

* How can we maintain a focus on the particular while enabling higher-level views?

* What is the role of (interactive) visualization in transdisciplinary data- and humanities-driven exchange?

* How do we make sure that interactions with data and its representations are faithful?

* How can we re-imagine an engagement with data through visualization that takes an inclusive, embracing transdisciplinary perspective?


We invite papers at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities that provide both theoretical and applied perspectives around these and other questions.

For our paper track we are seeking works from scholars in visualization, the humanities, social science, and the arts who use visualization as part of the process of analyzing and interrogating human culture. Submissions will present original research ideas or results as they relate to visualization for the digital humanities. Each submission should clearly state its specific contribution to this growing field of research. 


**Submission format** 

Submissions will take the form of short (4-6 page - excluding references) papers.
Submissions are meant to describe and critically discuss works at the intersection of visualization and humanities research, including applied case studies and empirical results and/or theoretical perspectives. We welcome works that highlight the difficulties (and proposed solutions) of designing visualizations in the context of humanities research and/or applying concepts from humanities research to foster visualization research and design. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their paper at the workshop. All presentations will be followed by a lively discussion with workshop participants.

All accepted papers will be archived in open-access online archive arXiv. However, interested authors may also choose to have their papers placed in the IEEE Explore repository. 

**Submitting a paper** 

Paper submissions should be in PDF format following the two-column IEEE TVCG Conference Style Template [(http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html)](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html). 

Papers should be submitted via EasyChair [(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vis4dh0)](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vis4dh0) by **July 10, 2020 (5pm PST)**. Notifications will be sent on August 7, 2020. 

Submissions to the Paper Tracks will be optionally double-blind. Authors wishing to submit their work double-blind should remove author information from the cover page of their submitted document, and take care to avoid identifying information in the submission itself.
