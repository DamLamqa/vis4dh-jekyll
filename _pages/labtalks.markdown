## Lab Talks
### Register and present your lab at this year's VIS4DH edition

For the 5th edition of the VIS4DH workshop, we are pulling together an international list of labs/centers/working groups focused on Visualization and the Digital Humanities. We aim to create a platform to support visibility and collaboration between the different groups at the intersection of these fields. 

We therefore call for contributions in two possible ways:


- **Register your lab to be featured on vis4dh.org:** 
This list will be featured in this space, where it can act as a resource for information and collaboration.
 


- **Present your lab during the VIS4DH workshop:**
Groups that are interested in presenting a brief lightning talk about their work will be able to do so during the VIS4DH workshop. Because of time considerations, we will have to limit the number of presentations. We will make selections that ensure geographic and disciplinary diversity. 



Fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_UZ9_eQLIksOgFVnrVMrQGD9gR_pEQN7Ng5J-6j78xLN-ew/viewform?usp=sf_link) at  if you would like to be listed on our website, or if you would like to present during the workshop.

**NOTE**: If you wish to present, we ask you to fill the survey before the **21st August 2020**. This will allow us time to organise the talks themselves. If you only wish to be part of the labs featured on our platform, you can still register through the form after that date.

For any questions, email us at: <vis4dh@gmail.com>.
