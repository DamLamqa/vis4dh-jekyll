**Making Sense of the Sea of Dashboards.**
Michael Correll and Heather Froehlich 

**Summary of Provocation:**

DH+vis collaborations are marked by the double occlusion of the data's
constructed nature and their tactical deployment by humanist scholars.

**Statement and argument:**

Foundational to our argument are the following assumptions: data are not
neutral, and data are capta, meaning taken and constructed, not given.
(Drucker, 2011)
The use of the word “data” in dh+vis collaborations camouflages the
contested nature of the phenomenon represented. The current ease of
visualization facilitates the conflation of “raw data represented” (visualization)
with knowledge (meaning-ful information), obscuring the human decisions
and biases that are inherent in the processes of creating visual
representations.
This eclipse is doubled in deploying the term “data” in humanities data
visualizations. We posit that use of “data” is tactical (Kirschenbaum, 2012) –
it is used precisely for its alignment with STEM and data driven fields in the
ongoing struggle of humanistic researchers for relevance, survival, and
funding under University Inc.
In seizing the current movement toward questioning data neutrality, we argue
that use of the term “data” in collaborations must be accompanied by
narratives, metadata, and transparency to illuminate the practices,
institutions, and interpretations that have constituted the representation over
time. Appearing in and alongside visualizations, this humanistic
contextualization refuses illusions of objectivity.

**Counter Arguments**

Potential counter-arguments to our provocation include directly challenging
the strategy to center humanistic criticism in data and visualization, and
arguing that it would be a detriment to the appeal or funding of digital
humanities. Other counter-arguments could be based on the rejection of our
basic assumption, or the belief that data can be neutral. Additionally, the
word “data” being used tactically could be dismissed, and argued that it’s
use is incidental.
