We are happy to announce that the 5th edition of VIS4DH — the Workshop on Visualization for  the Digital Humanities — will take place on **Sunday, October 25, 2020 in Salt Lake City, Utah**, as part of the [IEEE VIS2020 conference](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/welcome).

For 4 years now, the VIS4DH workshop has brought together researchers and practitioners from the fields of visualization and the humanities to discuss new research directions at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities research. The general aim is to foster productive collaborations that mutually advances all fields involved. Papers and invited talks from previous years can be found [here](/archives/).

Re-Thinking<br>
Re-Defining<br>
Re-Imagining Data
</div>

This year, we invite a dialogue on the topic and terminology around “data”, a contested term within and between a range of disciplines. There are varying perspectives on the meaning and use of data that impact how we engage and debate it. “Data” seems core to visualization! Or is it?

We are especially interested in a number of open questions in this space, including but not limited to the following:

* What counts as data in humanities visualizations? 
* What makes data data (or not data)? Is data always digital? 
* What are suitable methods for collecting and assessing data at the intersection of visualization and the (digital) humanities? How do we ensure the data represents what we think it does?
* What gets lost when transforming data? How can we map it back? How can we make transformations visible? 
* How do we visually measure and convey differences in data? 
* How can we maintain a focus on the particular while enabling higher-level views?
* What is the role of (interactive) visualization in a transdisciplinary data- and humanities-driven exchange?
* How do we make sure that interactions with data and its representations are faithful?
* How can we re-imagine an engagement with data through visualization that takes an inclusive, embracing transdisciplinary perspectives?

We invite both theoretical and applied works at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities around these and other questions related to the workshop theme. 

You can contribute and showcase your work through our **paper track** (just like in previous years) and/or through our **provocations track** (new for VIS4DH 2020!) – the official calls for papers and provocations will be released very soon.

## About VIS4DH




The purpose of this workshop is to propose new research directions in visualization for the digital humanities, to familiarize the visualization research community with the problems faced by digital humanities researchers, and to foster future collaboration between visualization and digital humanities research.

Despite the growing popularity of digital methods for research in the humanities, digital humanists are underserved by academics in visualization, and under-represented in visualization conferences. This is due to a number of factors:

1. The differences in rhetorics of proof and discovery (and so differences in data culture and use) in the humanities as opposed to other, typically scientific or analytic fields where visualization research is commonly focused.
2. The difficulty of performing task analysis and evaluation for many humanities questions, that may have no ground truth.
3. In text visualization specifically, the difference between the needs of digital humanists (who perform close readings and critical engagements with texts) as opposed to more standard text visualization scenarios (e.g. text analytics on datasets for intelligence or social media analysis).
4. The focus of this workshop is on applied visualization in the digital humanities, as well as highlighting domains in the digital humanities with unmet visualization challenges. These applications and domains include, but are not limited to:

* **Literature**
* **Philology and Linguistics**
* **Art and Art Criticism**
* **Political Science**
* **Performance (Music, Dance, Film, and Theatre)**
* **Cultural and Historical Studies**


We are especially interested in a number of open questions in this space, including:

* **The impact of visual analytics systems on research in the digital humanities:**
  * How can interactive visualizations support new questions, and new scales of research, in the DH community?
  * How can we encourage DH scholars to seek out visualizations, or collaboration with visualization researchers?
* **Characteristics of visualization for the digital humanities:**
  * How does visualization with a DH focus differ from general research in the visualization community?
  * How do their user groups differ? How can debates in public humanities scholarship inform DH visualization practices?
  * How can we remove obstacles for humanities scholars wanting to use visual analytics approaches for their research?
* **How digital humanities research questions and tasks can push the frontier of visualization research:**
  * What challenges are there for developing systems with novelty in both visualization and DH communities?
  * How do we evaluate visualizations where we lack ground truth data?
  * How can we build bridges between salient issues in the humanities (uncertainty, interpretative complexity, critical theoretical approaches) and the conceptual languages of visualization? -->
