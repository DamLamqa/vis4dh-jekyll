We are happy to announce that the 5th edition of VIS4DH — the Workshop on Visualization for  the Digital Humanities — will take place on **Sunday, October 25, 2020 in Salt Lake City, Utah**, as part of the [IEEE VIS2020 conference](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/welcome).

For 4 years now, the VIS4DH workshop has brought together researchers and practitioners from the fields of visualization and the humanities to discuss new research directions at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities research. The general aim is to foster productive collaborations that mutually advances all fields involved. Papers and invited talks from previous years can be found [here](/archives/).

This year, we invite a dialogue on the topic and terminology around “data”, a contested term within and between a range of disciplines. There are varying perspectives on the meaning and use of data that impact how we engage and debate it. “Data” seems core to visualization! Or is it?
We invite both theoretical and applied works at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities around these and other questions related to the workshop theme. 

You can contribute and showcase your work through our [paper track](/papers/) (just like in previous years) and/or through our [provocations track](/provocations/) (new for VIS4DH 2020!) – the official calls for papers and provocations can be found on the [Call for Submissions page](/cfp/).
